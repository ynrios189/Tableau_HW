The data shows how most of the usage is from subscriber rather than new customers. It makes you wonder if the bikes are either the main transportation for those subscribers or that is their preferred leisure activity (no data in these files to confirm).

The map shows how the stations are located fairly close in the city, that makes the accessibility of the rental and return of the bikes limited to a certain area. Without a doubt a popular asset in the location.
